also AC,ACC 

A register which holds the resulting values of ALU operations

## a/d

Analog to digital

## address

A number which indicates the storage location of data in memory

## addressing mode

The syntax used to describe a memory location to the CPU

## algorithm

A solution to a problem

## ALU

Arithmetic Logic Unit. 

Performs basic mathematical manipulations such as add,subtract,complement,negate,AND,OR

## analog

A continuous range of voltage values

## AND

Logical operation where the result is 1 iff(if only if) ANDed terms both have the value 1

## ANSI C

a standard of C

## ASCII

A way to represent characters
